    <p>Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing
        problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding,
        generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption,
        and implementation of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming
        languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific
        task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects,
        including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic..</p>

    <p>Related tasks include testing, debugging, and maintaining the source code, implementation of the build system, and management
        of derived artifacts such as machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming
        process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation,
        or coding reserved for the actual writing of source code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with
        software development practices.</p>
    <p>Indent styles assist in identifying control flow and blocks of code. In some programming languages indentation is used
        to delimit logical blocks of code; correct indentation in these cases is more than a matter of style. In other languages
        indentation and white space do not affect function, although logical and consistent indentation makes code more readable.

    <p>Good style is a subjective matter, and is difficult to define. However, there are several elements common to a large
        number of programming styles. The issues usually considered as part of programming style include the layout of the
        source code, including indentation; the use of white space around operators and keywords; the capitalization or otherwise
        of keywords and variable names; the style and spelling of user-defined identifiers, such as function, procedure and
        variable names; and the use and style of comments. Programming styles commonly deal with the visual appearance of
        source code, with the goal of readability. Software has long been available that formats source code automatically,
        leaving coders to concentrate on naming, logic, and higher techniques. As a practical point, using a computer to
        format source code saves time, and it is possible to then enforce company-wide standards without debates.</p>

    <p> Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called programming paradigms). The choice of
        language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party
        packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected.
        Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability
        of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages
        form an approximate spectrum from "low-level" to "high-level"; "low-level" languages are typically more machine-oriented
        and faster to execute, whereas "high-level" languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly.
        It is usually easier to code in "high-level" languages than in "low-level" ones..</p>

    <p>Debugging is often done with IDEs like Eclipse, Visual Studio, Xcode, Kdevelop, NetBeans and Code::Blocks. Standalone
        debuggers like GDB are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a command line.
        Some text editors such as Emacs allow GDB to be invoked through them, to provide a visual environment. Debugging
        <img src="https://lh6.ggpht.com/5fWY_pVmEJK3FcCl-AMvzWJX3DeS9SGzzGkS0ZTz9UgzhRZnr_VALcFE8ql-7ibAmg=w300" class="align-right slide-in"> is a very important task in the software development process since having defects in a program can have significant
        consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does
        not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static code analysis tool can help
        detect some possible problems. Normally the first step in debugging is to attempt to reproduce the problem. This
        can be a non-trivial task, for example as with parallel processes or some unusual software bugs. Also, specific user
        environment and usage history can make it difficult to reproduce the problem.</p>

    <p>In computer programming, readability refers to the ease with which a human reader can comprehend the purpose, control
        flow, and operation of source code. It affects the aspects of quality above, including portability, usability and
        most importantly maintainability. Readability is important because programmers spend the majority of their time reading,
        trying to understand and modifying existing source code, rather than writing new source code. Unreadable code often
        leads to bugs, inefficiencies, and duplicated code. A study[9] found that a few simple readability transformations
        made code shorter and drastically reduced the time to understand it..</p>
